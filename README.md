## Overview
Build a video streaming platform from scratch, focusing on frontend development using JavaScript and limited resources for video storage.

## Frontend Development
1. **Framework:** Choose a frontend framework (Nextjs) for building interactive user interfaces.
2. **User Authentication:** Implement user registration, login, and account management using Firebase Authentication.
3. **Video Playback:** Integrate a video player library (Plyr, Video.js) for seamless video playback.
4. **Video Listing and Search:** Create a user-friendly interface for listing and searching videos using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. **Video Details Page:** Design a page to display video details, including title, description, and related videos.
6. **User Interaction:** Implement features like liking, commenting, and sharing videos to enhance engagement.

## Backend Development
1. **Server Setup:** Use Node.js for backend development due to its lightweight nature.
2. **Database:** Utilize Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL database, for storing video metadata, user data, and app-related information.
3. **Video Metadata Storage:** Store video metadata (title, description, tags) in the database. Embed videos from YouTube using their embed code.
4. **User Data:** Store user authentication data, interactions (likes, comments), and user-generated content in the database.

## Video Storage
- Leverage YouTube Embeds: Showcase videos directly from YouTube within your platform. No need to host videos yourself.
- External Storage Solutions: Consider using free or low-cost cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox) for hosting videos. Embed videos using provided URLs.

## Content Generation
- Create original content to accompany the videos: Write engaging descriptions, add relevant tags, create appealing titles, and offer valuable insights.

## Monetization
- Initial stages might not support monetization due to limited resources.
- As the platform grows, explore options like ads, affiliate marketing, or crowdfunding to generate revenue.

## Note
This simplified approach allows for a basic video streaming platform with limited video storage capabilities. It doesn't offer the same level of control and features as full-fledged platforms.
